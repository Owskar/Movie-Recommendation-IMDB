<p id="description">This report provides a detailed overview of a content-based movie recommendation system that uses machine learning to suggest similar movies to users. The system collects movie data and preprocesses it to extract relevant features such as genre actors and plot. A machine learning model is trained to learn the relationships between these features and predict which movies are similar to each other.</p>
